.Sh NAME
.Nm md2mdoc 
.Nd a simple markdown to mdoc converter.
.Pp
.Sh SYNOPSIS
md2mdoc <input MDfile> <output MDOCfile>
.Pp
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This utility will convert simple markdown syntax characters to mdoc
(man page) format characters. It will remove all leading spaces from
lines unless within a code block.
.Pp
This utility is not intelligent at all, it will give wonky results if
confused but it does offer a very good staring point for creating man
page documentation for your project.
.Pp
The use of this utility is intended to offer a way to keep project
notes/documention in a simple markdown format (plain text) where large
sections can be added/deleted easier. When the time comes to create
more formal documentaiton, this utility aids in that process (assuming
your markdown isn't too complicated).
