.Sh  NAME
md2mdoc -- a simple markdown to mdoc converter.
.Pp
.Sh  SYNOPSIS
md2mdoc <mdfile> <mdocfile>
.Pp
.Sh  DESCRIPTION
This utility will convert simple markdown syntax characters to mdoc
(man page) format characters. It will remove all leading spaces from
lines.
.Pp
This utility is not intelligent at all, it will give wonky results if
confused but it does offer a very good staring point for creating man
page documentation for your project.
.Pp
The use of this utility is intended to offer a way to keep project
notes/documention in a simple markdown format (plain text) where large
sections can be added/deleted easier. When the time comes to create
more formal documentaiton, this utility aids in that process (assuming
your markdown isn't too complicated).
